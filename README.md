# loot-app

**This project is a work-in-progress**

This app allows the Master Looter for a World of Warcraft guild to track "modifiers" for items in raid!

## What is a modifier?
A modifier is an integer value associated with a particular player and item in game. When a player "reserves" an item and the item is looted in raid, the player gets to add their modifier to their d100 roll to increase their chances of winning the item!

## What does this app do?
Simply put, it makes the Master Looter's job easier! Previously, our guild used an excel spreadsheet which had to be manually updated with every raid, and often contained errors. With this app, the master looter simply has to download a csv file from the SoftRes.it site (where the reserve data comes from), and this application will automatically calculate modifiers from the database. Then, any player can check the status of all players modifiers at any time!
